The customer asked about the possibility of returning the product for a full refund and purchasing from a different company. The agent confirmed that the customer had until May 2nd to make modifications or cancellations to the order. The customer received a new email about an appointment with the service partner, which the agent confirmed and pushed through. The customer expressed uncertainty about the timeline and asked about the process for canceling the order and getting a refund.
